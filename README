Software Name:  StrongWeb CMS
Version #:      0.4-Alpha
Description:  
      Originally aimed at simply making a helpful GUI that 
  could aid people in managing their "Website" whatever that 
  may have meant.  This software is built with the intentions
  of making a framework that is robust yet simplistic while 
  not being too constrained.  
      
      As a Developer, I want any programmer to easily be able 
  to expand this software while worrying not about how the 
  software maintains the ease of use seen in many CMS like 
  Wordpress or Drupal.
    

This file contains all you need to know about this software;
